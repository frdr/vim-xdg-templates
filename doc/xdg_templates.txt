*xdg_templates.txt* Use files from XDG TEMPLATES directory in Vim
							 Version 1.0.0

Any file within the XDG TEMPLATES directory is offered for quick file
creation in graphical file managers. This plugin makes Vim use the same
files whenever a new file with a matching extension is created.

Note that this works purely on extension, not 'filetype'. Consider
creating synonymous files through symlinks:

	$ ln -s header_file.h header_file.hpp

USAGE

Open a new file with the same extension as any file in your
XDG templates directory. The contents of the template will be inserted.
Simple, isn't it?

The template files typically carry boilerplate code and boring stuff like
copyright notice. It's what you'd like to have in your file anyway.

This plugin also defines a |command| to use if you're editing an existing file
and you forgot to prefix your usual header and stuff. Call |PrefixXdgTemplate|
and the template will be inserted at the start of the current buffer.

FUNCTIONS


					     *xdg_templates#prefix_template()*
prefix_template({name})	Find a template for {name} and prefix it to the
			current buffer.

					   *xdg_templates#get_templates_dir()*
get_templates_dir()	Internal function to return the directory as a
			string in which templates will be searched for. Can
			be overridden by setting |g:xdg_templates_lookup_dir|.


COMMANDS

							  *:PrefixXdgTemplate*
PrefixXdgTemplate	Find a template for the current file and insert it at
			the top of the buffer.

OPTIONS

						  *g:xdg_templates_lookup_dir*
The lookup directory can be overridden by setting
`g:xdg_templates_lookup_dir`. The variable's value is taken verbatim, if you
want expansion to take place, you need to do it yourself: >
    let g:xdg_templates_lookup_dir = expand('~/.vim/templates')
<
			    *g:xdg_templates_all_execute*
Specifies an Ex command that is run with |:execute| right after any template has
been inserted. This can be useful for specifying a constant offset. Assume all
of your templates contain a |modeline| at their bottoms: >
    let g:xdg_templates_all_execute = '$-2'
<
It can also be used for more complex tasks, like replacing snippets: >
    let g:xdg_templates_all_execute = 's/<year>/2024/e|$'
<
Also see |g:xdg_templates_file_execute| which allows to execute commands on a
per-file level.

If neither this variable or |g:xdg_templates_file_execute| are set, the
default is to jump to the last line of the new buffer through |:$|.

						 *g:xdg_templates_file_execute*
This variable is a |dict| containing template file names as keys and Ex
commands as values. This variable is useful if you want to control the initial
position of the cursor in a newly created file or expand special markers.

Assuming your C or C++ header file contains an old-school header include guard
with "#endif" as its bottom line, you would set: >
    let g:xdg_templates_file_execute = {'myheader.h': '$-2'}
<
This can also be useful if you have a |modeline| at the bottom of one of your
templates.

See |g:xdg_templates_all_execute| for more examples and also to apply a
command to any newly created buffer.

If neither this variable or |g:xdg_templates_all_execute| are set, the
default is to jump to the last line of the new buffer through |:$|.

						  *g:xdg_templates_no_autocmd*
To prevent xdg_templates from creating any |autocmd|, set the variable
`g:xdg_templates_no_autocmd`.

						  *g:xdg_templates_no_command*
To prevent xdg_templates from creating any |command|, set the variable
`g:xdg_templates_no_command`.
