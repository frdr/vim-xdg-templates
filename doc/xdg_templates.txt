*xdg_templates.txt*	Use files from XDG's Templates directory in Vim

Any file within the $HOME/Templates directory is offered for quick file
creation in graphical file managers. This plugin makes Vim use the same
files whenever a new file with a matching extension is created.

Note that this works purely on extension, not 'filetype'. Consider
creating synonymous files through symlinks:

	ln -s header_file.h header_file.hpp

OPTIONS
						  *g:xdg_templates_lookup_dir*
The lookup directory can be overridden by setting
`g:xdg_templates_lookup_dir`. The variable's value is taken verbatim, if you
want expansion to take place, you need to do it yourself: >
    let g:xdg_templates_lookup_dir = expand('~/.vim/templates')
<

						  *g:xdg_templates_no_autocmd*
To prevent xdg_templates from creating |autocmd|s, set the variable `g:xdg_templates_no_autocmd`.

						  *g:xdg_templates_no_command*
To prevent xdg_templates from creating |command|s, set the variable `g:xdg_templates_no_command`.

MISSING FEATURES

* Add a function that allows to add templates to existing files.
* Consider using 'filetype', not just extensions.
* Don't always jump to the bottom of the template, to allow e.g. for a
  'modeline' at the bottom of the templates.

KNOWN BUGS

* Python files are shown as modified
