*xdg_templates.txt* Use files from XDG TEMPLATES directory in Vim
							 Version 1.2.0

Any file within the XDG TEMPLATES directory is offered for quick file
creation in graphical file managers. This plugin makes Vim use the same
files whenever a new file with a matching extension is created.

Note that this works purely on extensions, not 'filetype'.

USAGE

Open a new file with the same extension as any file in your
XDG templates directory. The contents of the template will be inserted.
Simple, isn't it?

The template files typically carry boilerplate code and boring stuff like
copyright notice. It's what you'd like to have in your file anyway.

This plugin also defines a |command| to use if you're editing an existing file
and you forgot to prefix your usual header and stuff. Call |PrefixXdgTemplate|
and the template will be inserted at the start of the current buffer.

FUNCTIONS

					     *xdg_templates#prefix_template()*
prefix_template({name})	Find a template for {name} and prefix it to the
			current buffer.
			To prefix an existing buffer, the
			|PrefixXdgTemplate| command may be easier to use.

					   *xdg_templates#get_templates_dir()*
get_templates_dir()	Internal function to return the directory as a
			string in which templates will be searched for. Can
			be overridden by setting |g:xdg_templates_lookup_dir|.

					   *xdg_templates#ext_alias_default()*
ext_alias_default()	Internal function that returns a list of lists of
			strings. All the strings literally stand for
			extensions and those within a list are treated as
			synonyms. This is used to use the same templates for
			files of the same type that differ in extensions. See
			|g:xdg_templates_ext_alias| for examples.

			To see the defaults, |:echo| them >
			    :echo xdg_templates#ext_alias_default()
<
			The defaults are only applied if
			|g:xdg_templates_ext_alias| is not set.

COMMANDS

							  *:PrefixXdgTemplate*
PrefixXdgTemplate	Find a template for the current file and insert it at
			the top of the buffer.

OPTIONS

						  *g:xdg_templates_lookup_dir*
The lookup directory can be overridden by setting
`g:xdg_templates_lookup_dir`. The variable's value is taken verbatim, if you
want expansion to take place, you need to do it yourself: >
    let g:xdg_templates_lookup_dir = expand('~/.vim/templates')
<
			    *g:xdg_templates_all_execute*
Specifies an Ex command that is run with |:execute| right after any template has
been inserted. This can be useful for specifying a constant offset. Assume all
of your templates contain a |modeline| at their bottoms: >
    let g:xdg_templates_all_execute = '$-2'
<
It can also be used for more complex tasks, like replacing snippets: >
    let g:xdg_templates_all_execute = 's/<year>/2024/e|$'
<
Also see |g:xdg_templates_file_execute| which allows to execute commands on a
per-file level.

If neither this variable or |g:xdg_templates_file_execute| are set, the
default is to jump to the last line of the new buffer through |:$|.

						 *g:xdg_templates_file_execute*
This variable is a |dict| containing template file names as keys and Ex
commands as values. This variable is useful if you want to control the initial
position of the cursor in a newly created file or expand special markers.

Assuming your C or C++ header file contains an old-school header include guard
with "#endif" as its bottom line, you would set: >
    let g:xdg_templates_file_execute = {'myheader.h': '$-2'}
<
This can also be useful if you have a |modeline| at the bottom of one of your
templates.

See |g:xdg_templates_all_execute| for more examples and also to apply a
command to any newly created buffer.

If neither this variable or |g:xdg_templates_all_execute| are set, the
default is to jump to the last line of the new buffer through |:$|.

						   *g:xdg_templates_ext_alias*
Some templates can be used for files with different, synonymous extensions. A
file with any of these extensions would be created from the same template.
This variable may contain a list of lists of strings denoting extensions that
are to be treated interchangeably.

For files containing C++ source code, the extensions cpp, cc, cxx, or C could
be used.  For historical reasons, some file types are known by both a three
letter and a four letter extension. An example would be htm and html.

The two above examples would look like >
    let g:xdg_templates_ext_alias = [
	\ ['cpp', 'cc', 'cxx', 'C'],
	\ ['htm', 'html']
<
To turn off this kind of aliasing completely, make it an empty list >
    let g:xdg_templates_ext_alias = []
<
If g:xdg_templates_ext_alias is unset, defaults as returned by
|xdg_templates#ext_alias_default()| are used. To tweak the defaults,
initialize the variable from the function and change it  >
    let g:xdg_templates_ext_alias = xdg_templates#ext_alias_default()
    let g:xdg_templates_ext_alias += ['foo', 'bar']
<

						  *g:xdg_templates_no_autocmd*
To prevent xdg_templates from creating any |autocmd|, set the variable
`g:xdg_templates_no_autocmd`.

						  *g:xdg_templates_no_command*
To prevent xdg_templates from creating any |command|, set the variable
`g:xdg_templates_no_command`.

MISSING FEATURES

* Consider using 'filetype', not just extensions.
* Best-match algorithm to have templates for e.g. letter.tex and paper.tex
